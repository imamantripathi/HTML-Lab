      <h2>History of Taj Mahal</h2>
      <p class="text">
        The Taj Mahal of Agra is one of the Seven Wonders of the World, for
        reasons more than just looking magnificent. It's the history of Taj
        Mahal that adds a soul to its magnificence: a soul that is filled with
        love, loss, remorse, and love again. Because if it was not for love, the
        world would have been robbed of a fine example upon which people base
        their relationships. An example of how deeply a man loved his wife, that
        even after she remained but a memory, he made sure that this memory
        would never fade away. This man was the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, who
        was head-over-heels in love with Mumtaz Mahal, his dear wife. She was a
        Muslim Persian princess (her name Arjumand Banu Begum before marriage)
        and he was the son of the Mughal Emperor Jehangir and grandson of Akbar
        the Great. It was at the age of 14 that he met Mumtaz and fell in love
        with her. Five years later in the year 1612, they got married. <br />

        Mumtaz Mahal, an inseparable companion of Shah Jahan, died in 1631,
        while giving birth to their 14th child. It was in the memory of his
        beloved wife that Shah Jahan built a magnificent monument as a tribute
        to her, which we today know as the "Taj Mahal". The construction of Taj
        Mahal started in the year 1631. Masons, stonecutters, inlayers, carvers,
        painters, calligraphers, dome-builders and other artisans were
        requisitioned from the whole of the empire and also from Central Asia
        and Iran, and it took approximately 22 years to build what we see today.
        An epitome of love, it made use of the services of 22,000 laborers and
        1,000 elephants. The monument was built entirely out of white marble,
        which was brought in from all over India and central Asia. After an
        expenditure of approximately 32 million rupees, Taj Mahal was finally
        completed in the year 1653. <br />

        It was soon after the completion of Taj Mahal that Shah Jahan was
        deposed by his own son Aurangzeb and was put under house arrest at
        nearby Agra Fort. Shah Jahan, himself also, lies entombed in this
        mausoleum along with his wife. Moving further down the history, it was
        at the end of the 19th century that British Viceroy Lord Curzon ordered
        a sweeping restoration project, which was completed in 1908, as a
        measure to restore what was lost during the Indian rebellion of 1857:
        Taj being blemished by British soldiers and government officials who
        also deprived the monument of its immaculate beauty by chiseling out
        precious stones and lapis lazuli from its walls. Also, the British style
        lawns that we see today adding on to the beauty of Taj were remodeled
        around the same time. Despite prevailing controversies, past and present
        threats from Indo-Pak war and environmental pollution, this epitome of
        love continuous to shine and attract people from all over the world.

      <h2>Facts</h2>
      <p class="text">
        To the last category belong the oldest tales of the Taj. Here the most
        widely known is the story of the second Taj, the 'Black Taj', which Shah
        Jahan intended to build in black marble opposite the present mausoleum,
        on the site of the Mahtab Bagh. It goes back to Jean-Baptiste Tavernier
        who, when at Agra in 1665 AD, reported that 'Shahjahan began to built
        his own tomb on the other side of the river, but the war with his sons
        interrupted his plan, and Aurangzeb, who reigns at present, is not
        disposed to complete it. Shah Jahan was put under house arrest by his
        own son and successor by force, Aurangzeb. The latter did not agree with
        his father on most issues and was particularly opposed to him building a
        black Taj as his own mausoleum. <br />

        Upon Shah Jahan's death, Aurangzeb made the body of the Emperor, who got
        the body of his beloved Mumtaz in a golden casket from Burhanpur to
        Agra, carried in a boat by only two men and buried him in the Taj, next
        to his wife in probably the simplest manner.

      <h2>
        Shah Jahan, the Emperor, who fulfilled the wishes of his beloved, could
        not find fulfilment of his own wish to build a Black Taj to express his
        mourning for the beloved Queen Mumtaz Mahal even after his death. That
        was the serenity in the purity of love.
