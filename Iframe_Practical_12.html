      The Taj Mahal'Crown of the Palace' is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on
      the right bank of the river Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra. It was
      commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to
      house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the
      tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare
      (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set
      in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.

      he most spectacular feature is the marble dome that surmounts the tomb.
      The dome is nearly 35 metres (115 ft) high which is close in measurement
      to the length of the base, and accentuated by the cylindrical "drum" it
      sits on, which is approximately 7 metres (23 ft) high. Because of its
      shape, the dome is often called an onion dome or amrud (guava dome).[19]
      The top is decorated with a lotus design which also serves to accentuate
      its height. The shape of the dome is emphasised by four smaller domed
      chattris (kiosks) placed at its corners, which replicate the onion shape
      of the main dome. The dome is slightly asymmetrical.[20] Their columned
      bases open through the roof of the tomb and provide light to the interior.
      Tall decorative spires (guldastas) extend from edges of base walls, and
      provide visual emphasis to the height of the dome. The lotus motif is
      repeated on both the chattris and guldastas. The dome and chattris are
      topped by a gilded finial which mixes traditional Persian and Hindustani
      decorative elements.[21] The main finial was originally made of gold but
      was replaced by a copy made of gilded bronze in the early 19th century.
      This feature provides a clear example of integration of traditional
      Persian and Hindu decorative elements.[22] The finial is topped by a moon,
      a typical Islamic motif whose horns point heavenward.[23] The minarets,
      which are each more than 40 metres (130 ft) tall, display the designer's
      penchant for symmetry. They were designed as working minarets— a
      traditional element of mosques, used by the muezzin to call the Islamic
      faithful to prayer. Each minaret is effectively divided into three equal
      parts by two working balconies that ring the tower. At the top of the
      tower is a final balcony surmounted by a chattri that mirrors the design
      of those on the tomb. The chattris all share the same decorative elements
      of a lotus design topped by a gilded finial.
